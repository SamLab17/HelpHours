<p>Here are some instructions on how to use this website.</p>
<br />

<h2>Joining the Queue</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Join tab.</li>
    <li>Check if the queue is open. You won't be able to submit your information if it's closed.</li>
    <li>Enter in your information if it's open.</li>
    <li>Click Join the Queue!</li>
</ol>
<p>You will be redirected to View, where your name should appear at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> You don't have to enter your actual UT EID if you don't want to, but you
    should enter unique text, because you will be able to use this entry to remove yourself from the queue. We don't
    want others accidentally removing you from the queue.</p>
<p>If you try to add yourself to the queue when you're already in there, you'll lose your previous spot in
    queue
    and will be moved to the end. You can add yourself again after you've been helped! </p>
<p> Please join the Zoom meeting once you start approaching the front of
    the queue. <strong>Check Canvas for the link to the Zoom meeting.</strong> The instructors will have a
    breakout room to help students in, so feel free to wait in the main room.</p>
<p>Also, expect an email in your inbox telling you your place in the queue and what you entered in the EID
    field.</p>

<br />
<h2>Viewing the Queue</h2>
<p >This one is pretty easy, just click the View tab.</p>
<p >If you're on a tight schedule, we recommend checking this tab out before joining the queue.</p>

<br />
<h2>Removing Yourself From the Queue</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Remove Self tab.</li>
    <li>Enter in your UT EID, or whatever you entered in that field. If you don't remember what you entered, check your
        email.</li>
    <li>Click submit.</li>
</ol>
