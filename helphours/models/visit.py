class Visit(db.Model):
    """
        Database model to represent a "Visit" in the "visits"
        table. A Visit is created anytime a student joins the
        queue. Unlike the queue itself, entries in the "visits"
        table are stored in the databse and persist even after
        the application is restarted.

        These entries in the visits table hold the eid of the student,
        The time they entered the line, the time they left (either
        as a result of being helped or removed), a flag indicating
        whether or not they were actually helped, and the id of the
        instructor who helped the student (left as NULL if the student
        was removed).

        If true anonymity is desired in keeping these statistics,
        then the eid column does not have to be used. It is not necessary
        to any other functionality.
